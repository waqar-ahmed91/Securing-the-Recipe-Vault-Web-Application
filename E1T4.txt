According to the architecture diagram two of the bad practices are:
1. Allowing network traffic from all ports in the public and private subnet
Solution: Network ACL (Access Control List) rules must be applied to control the inbound and outbound traffic. 
          This will minimize the risks of malicious activities on the server or infrastructure by attackers.

2. Poor or no IAM Role and Policy which is giving access to all the users to access both buckets (free and secret recipes).
Solution: Proper IAM Role and Policy should be defined and implemented with specific roles to allow the users 
          from the internet gateway to access the free recipes bucket and not the secret recipes bucket.
