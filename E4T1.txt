# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
1. Using Systems Managers services to access the application server/instance.
2. Restrict the IP's and allowing specific IPs with CIDR blocks to access the application server.
3. Disabling the SSH password authentication on the application server.
# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
1. Using least access privileged role policy by allowing application server just to access the free recipes s3 bucket.
2. Giving the S3 bucket read only permission just to read the recipes from the application server.
3. Enabling server side encryption on s3 bucket with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3)
