# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Using AWS System Manager to login to the web application instance can be made to reduce the internet facing attacks on the instance.
# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No, because if the IAM permissions are still insecure then creating VPC private endpoints are of no use alone.
# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, we have to encrypt all the files which are already present in the S3 bucket before applying the default encryption
# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
All the manual changes to secure the infrastructure will be removed/overridden by applying the original cloud formation templates again.
