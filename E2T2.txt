Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
1.  Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
2.  On instance i-04aad2eb6def673a9, UDP port 20 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
3.  Unprotected port on EC2 instance i-04aad2eb6def673a9 is being probed.
Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
Solutions to mitigate above mentioned vulnerabilities are:
1. IP restrictions should be applied to restrict traffic to port 22
2. Only required ports should be allowed in the inbound rules of the security group.
3. Domain allow list or firewall should be applied to for the protection of ports.
